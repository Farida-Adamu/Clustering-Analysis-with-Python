# Clustering-Analysis-with-Python

This is a group project from my masters degree

Three data extracts containing staff skills, educational qualifications & job profile / grades were provided by pwc. The task is to cluster the samples provided, analyse, and present each cluster.*

*Identify clusters within the staff based on their skills, educational qualifications, and job profiles/grades.* 

=> This can help identify groups of staff members who may have **similar skillsets or job roles**, and could potentially **inform decisions around hiring, training, or organizational structure**. 

=> The challenge would be to **identify meaningful clusters** that provide **actionable insights for the organization**.
